# Open Event Manager Application
## Overview
Open Event Manager is an open source project led by the members of Meteor Ho Chi Minh Community to show you an example app built with Meteor. We hope that it will help you discover Meteor and create your own project.
> Check out our [Open Event Manager web version here][web]!

Main feature:
- Manage groups: see group schedule, members, upcoming and past events, rate a group.
- Manage events: see information, vote for topics, rate, comment, summary graphs.
We are working on some new features and will release soon. 

## How to use
### Run
```sh
$ meteor --port [port]
```
### Build mobile app
```sh
$ meteor add-platform ios
$ meteor add-platform android
$ meteor build [path-build] --server [server:port]
